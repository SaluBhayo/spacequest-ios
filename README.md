# Spacequest
Full source code of a working `iOS` game. Yet another take on a space shooter game. The game falls into [Shoot 'em up] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoot_%27em_up) video games genre. It is written in Swift and uses `SpriteKit`- graphics rendering and animation infrastructure built into `iOS`.

### Some interesting problems covered in the project:
- Particle systems (e.g. jet engine burst in player's spaceship)
- Collision detection
- HUD, buttons + joystick
- Sound effects and background music

# Technologies used
- Swift
- SpriteKit
